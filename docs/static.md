# Static Web Content

## Javascript

### jQuery

Simple to use javascript library that makes document navigation, scripting, and ajax easy to use.

### BootStrap

A library for front-end web development containing design templates.

### Bootstrap Markdown Editor

Creates a toolbar over a text area with some buttons for common markdown notation such as italics, unordered lists, and hyperlinks. This editor also allows for image links, with an option to include an image upload button that will automatically provide the markdown for the link when the ajax call returns.

## CSS

All the javascript libraries mentioned make use of their own css, including ace editor, a dependency of Bootstrap Markdown Editor
