# wiki.web.forms

These classes all extend the Form object from the WTForms module. URLForm simply validates a text field to ensure that the given URL for uploading a page doesn't already exist and is properly cleaned. The SearchForm is also a simple text field with a boolean field for ignoring case. The EditorForm contains the text fields for creating a page, which includes the title, body, and tags. Finally the LoginForm has fields for username and password, and will verify that both the username exists and the password successfully authenticates said user.
